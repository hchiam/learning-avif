# Learning AVIF

Better image compression.

```html
<picture>
  <!-- use AVIF if possible: -->
  <source type="image/avif" srcset="some_image.avif" />

  <!-- fallback to JPEG: -->
  <img alt="image description" src="some_image.jpg" />
</picture>
```

You can create AVIF files from image files here: <https://squoosh.app> -> This site also shows you how much the image effectively gets compressed into the AVIF format.
